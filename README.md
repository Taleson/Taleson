## What is Taleson?

Taleson is a desktop application for writing structured stories as JSON data. Whether you're crafting a visual novel, a branching RPG dialogue, or a complex interactive narrative, Taleson gives you the tools to organize, visualize, and export your story.

Every aspect of your project is **configuration-driven** -- column layouts, node types, and field behaviors are all defined by your project settings, not hardcoded.

## Features

### Story Structures

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Array** | Linear, sequential nodes | Simple scripts, tutorials |
| **Graph** | Branching node tree with connections | RPG dialogues, choice-based narratives |
| **Graph-Inline** | Graph with inline child nodes | Visual novels, conversation-heavy stories |

### Editor

- Visual node editor with drag-and-drop
- Rich text editing for dialogue and narration
- Conditional branching (variables, operators, values)
- Node type system (dialogue, narration, branch, choice, and more)
- Customizable columns and fields per project

### Export

- HTML export for standalone reading
- JSON data for game engine integration

### AI Integration (MCP)
